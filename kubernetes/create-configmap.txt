# Unlike current Docker volumes a Kubernetes volume has the lifetime of the Pod, not the containers within. This data can be made available so that a Pod can read the data as environment variables or conﬁguration data. A ConfigMap is similar to a Secret, except they are not base64 byte encoded arrays. They are stored as strings and can be read in serialized form.

# There are three different ways a ConfigMap can ingest data, from a literal value, from a ﬁle or from a directory of ﬁles.
