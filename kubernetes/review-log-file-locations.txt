# In addition to various logs files and command output, you can use journalctl to view logs from the node perspective. We will view common locations of log files, then a command to view container logs. There are other logging options, such as the use of a sidecar container dedicated to loading the logs of another container in a pod.

#If using a systemd.based Kubernetes cluster, view the node level logs for kubelet, the local Kubernetes agent. Each node will have different contents as this is node specific

$ journalctl -u kubelet |less

# Major Kubernetes processes now run in containers. You can view them from the container or the pod perspective. Use the find command to locate the kube-apiserver log. 

$ sudo find / -name "*apiserver*log"

If not on a Kubernetes cluster using systemd which collects logs via journalctl you can view the text files on the master node.
(a) /var/log/kube-apiserver.log
Responsible for serving the API
(b) /var/log/kube-scheduler.log
Responsible for making scheduling decisions
(c) /var/log/kube-controller-manager.log
Controller that manages replication controllers
(d) /var/log/containers 
Various container logs
(e) /var/log/pods/
Log files for current /var/log/pods/
(f) /var/log/kubelet.log
Responsible for running containers on the node
(g) /var/log/kube-proxy.log
Responsible for service load balancing
