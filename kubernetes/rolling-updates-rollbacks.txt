#One of the advantages of micro-services is the ability to replace and upgrade a container while continuing to respond to clientrequests.  We will use the OnDelete setting that upgrades a container when the predecessor is deleted, then the use the RollingUpdate feature as well, which begins a rolling update immediately.

#display current updateStrategy
kubectl get ds ds-one -o yaml \| grep -A 3 Strategy

#edit object 
kubectl edit ds ds-one

#to update the ds to a newer version
kubectl set image ds ds-one nginx=nginx:1.16.1-alpine

#delete pod 
kubectl delete po <pod>

#deleting pod will create a ds with new version due to rolling update 

#view history of ds
kubectl rollout history ds ds-one

#going to each revision will show information about what was done
kubectl rollout history ds ds-one --revision=1

#to change ds back to an earlier version
kubectl rollout undo ds ds-one --to-revision=1
